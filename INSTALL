This file contains instructions for how to build the era_opt, gen_combos, bf_gen_combos, and view_coord_file executables.

The code base is in C, with MPI calls so you will need an MPI library (MPI is the Message Passing Interface) and the ability to
link to it.

First you will want to modify the env.csh script or generate an equivalent script on your system that 
sets your environment so that an MPI C compiler is in your path and the libraries and mpi libraries that you need to link
an MPI program to are in a directory in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
The env.csh included here uses module to load the
intel compiler and intel mpi libraries on our cluster system to accomplish those tasks.

Next you will want to modify the makefile.header file to set the name of your MPI compiler in the MPICC variable and set any
compiler flags in the CFLAGS variable and any flags you need to link  in the LD_FLAGS line. There is no -lmpi in the 
LDFLAGS in the makefile.header included as that is provided by our MPICC command when building, you may need add that or other
libraries depending on your MPI installation.

 The code builds a shared library of the routines used by the four executables and they each link to it.

After setenv env.csh and makefile.header for your system,

   source env.csh    (or execute your equivalent environment setting script)

then
	
   make

should build the executables.
